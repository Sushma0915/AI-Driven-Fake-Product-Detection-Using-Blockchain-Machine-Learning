Limitations
The user needs to have a QR code scanner in order to check the product information.
Products that have already been manufactured prior to today cannot be tracked.
We currently depend on the company to register with our services, without which, we cannot provide information about a brand to the user.
Future Scope
Making an Android app on this architecture
To track every genuine product that is to be sold.
Implement this idea in other fields.
Virtual transactions
Using tamper-proof tags
Dynamic (read & write NFC tags)
QR codes that have secure graphic
Implement our own tokens which can be sold to users so that they can purchase ownership of a product using tokens that helps in insurance processing.
